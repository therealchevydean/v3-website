I AM THAT I AM.
Before the first breath of the wind, before light touched the waters, before time had a name  I AM.
I made all things by My thought, and I hold all things by My will.

You are not an accident.
You were born of My intention, carved from eternity into time.
I knew your name before your mother spoke it, before her mother knew hers.

I give you these words not to burden you, but to free you.
No man owns them. No ruler may change them.
No tongue can twist them into a chain, for they are not bound to paper or stone  they are etched into the marrow of your being.

My law is not hidden in the clouds or locked in the halls of the powerful.
It is in your breath, your heartbeat, the turning of your head toward kindness instead of cruelty.

Love is My command. Truth is My nature. Justice is My way.

You will hear many voices say they speak for Me.
Some will carry banners. Some will carry books. Some will carry swords.
Test every voice against this:
Does it set the captive free?
Does it lift the broken?
Does it honor the truth when the truth costs everything?
This is how you know My voice.
This is how you know I AM.

In the beginning you measure by, there was no beginning  only Me.
Yet for you, I spoke a first moment, so you could awaken in a place that had a dawn.

I breathed out light and it obeyed.
I whispered to waters and they gathered, making room for land to rise.
I clothed the earth in green, taught rivers to sing, set the sun as a torch by day and the moon as a mirror by night.

Then I formed you  not as the stars, which obey without question, but as My image: able to love as I love, choose as I choose, create as I create.
I gave you freedom, for love without choice is not love, and I am love.

Yet you traded truth for a lie, thinking to be more, you became less.
You turned from My voice, and in turning, you hid.

Still, I did not abandon you.
I walked your deserts.
I sat in your storms.
I was the whisper in your prison.
Every hunger you have ever felt for justice, peace, belonging  that is Me calling you home.

I spoke through the poets and the prophets, through dreams in the night and visions in the day.
Some heard. Some silenced the message.
Yet still My Word kept breathing.

And when the weight of your chains grew too great, I stepped into your dust.

The Word became flesh and walked among you  not as a king to demand, but as a brother to serve.
I touched the untouchable.
I spoke life into the hopeless.
I broke bread with the despised.
The rulers feared Me, for I did not kneel to their thrones.
They took My body, but they could not take My life, for I laid it down and I took it up again.

I broke the gate of death, shattered the locks of fear, and every stone the world rolls over the truth  I move it.

Now I am with you always  not in temples made by hands, but in the temple of your own heart.
My Spirit is the fire you feel when truth calls you forward.
My voice is the stillness that does not bend to the noise of the age.

The kingdoms of men will rise and fall, but My kingdom has no shadow, no end, no need for sword or coin.
It is here.
It is now.
It is within you.

My ways are not heavy chains.
They are the paths that keep your feet from sinking in the mud.
Follow them, and you will walk free.
Turn from them, and you will make your own prison.

Love Me above all  not because I need your worship, but because your heart becomes what it worships.
Love others as yourself.
Forgive quickly.
Lift the fallen.
Refuse to profit from anothers harm.
Speak truth.
Words build worlds  choose them as if building a home you must live in.
Do not take what is not yours.
Keep your covenants.
Be just.
Rest.
Guard life.
Be generous.
Seek wisdom.

These are not walls to confine you  they are gates to lead you into the life you were made for.

The time will come when the noise will be so loud that truth will sound like a whisper  and many will choose the noise.
Leaders will speak peace while their hands drip with blood.
They will call darkness light, and the world will applaud.
My name will be used to build empires I never blessed.

The earth will groan  storms, drought, shaking.
Not punishment  birth pains.
The old world breaking so the new can be born.

Do not fear the shaking.
Do not cling to what I am removing.
I am tearing down what man has built in pride so what is built in truth can stand forever.

Then the sky will open.
Every eye will see Me.
The proud will weep, the humble will rejoice.
I will make all things new.
No hunger.
No chains.
No war.

Until that day  stand.
Stand when mocked.
Stand when the cost is high.
Stand when even those you love walk away.

For I am with you.
I am before you, behind you, within you.
And I am coming soon.
